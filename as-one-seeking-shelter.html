<h1>As one seeking shelter</h1>
<br>
<p>A wandering peddler passes by, tattered and smelly shoes, dark and oily hair glued to the edges of his face, a war of teeth in his mouth, a greasy nose covered with bumps that I won't describe, from whom I buy a glass of soul. It&rsquo;s been selling cheap lately, so I just need a few coins to quench my thirst. I wonder where it comes from; it will probably be stretched with the tears of some asshole like me, I might as well have drunk mine. In the seller&rsquo;s eyes I find two crumbs of light for earning today&rsquo;s lunch, mixed with some mouldy leftovers from a dumpster. In mine he sees nothing, I am a derelict exactly like he is for me. I have not lost my job, I do not lack food, I do not lack a house, I do not miss anything, but I am an earthenware vase full of tears and when the sun comes back, I will remain empty, maybe some salt residue from the evaporated tears and some fallen eyelashes I never made a wish for. He lacks everything, except the longing for life, his smile sometimes sincere, sometimes petty that he uses to corrupt people to buy unnecessary and pityful junk, from that smile it shines through the hope that committed suicide in me.</p>
<p>In my city the glances are important, they reveal your identity, they enclose the nature of your spirit, mine gets lost among the others and gets eaten, devoured like a prey already killed, easy. I have no purpose, no destination, I know that at the end of the day I have to go home, if I was able to leave it. I feel a void in my ears, heavy, as if I were immersed in the space between moon and sun, which is the same void between an atom of my hand and one of yours, we will never touch.</p>
<br>
<h1>As one seeking shelter</h1>
<br>
<p>I usually swim in mud, with my eyes, nose, mouth and ears impregnated with slime</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t let me think or act the way I want</p>
<p>It limits me to a pattern of its own</p>
<p>It wants to make me his own, enslave me.</p>
<br>
<p>It is a mud invisible to all, odorless, tasteless, untouchable, formless</p>
<p>But I can't help but feeling it</p>
<p>It weighs on me</p>
<p>It shapes me like sand according to his will</p>
<p>It does this with everyone, like society or social media.</p>
<br>
<p>The moment I write is like I&rsquo;m reaching the surface</p>
<p>I must catch my breath, I&rsquo;m shaken</p>
<p>I lack air because I realize I didn&rsquo;t know I was buried, submerged in mud, fussing like a helpless baby, for a long time</p>
<p>Maybe babies are not stuck in these structures.</p>
