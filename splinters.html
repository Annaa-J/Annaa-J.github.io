<p>You love me, but</p>
<p>Rusty keys, defective lock</p>
<p>Infiltrations, humidity in the dungeons</p>
<p>It penetrates the bones, and they will creak, crack, rot, give way.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t enter; look through the bars</p>
<p>Inside, you can&rsquo;t get out; look through the bars</p>
<p>You reach out a hand, in vain</p>
<p>Locked, broken lock, you can&rsquo;t pass through</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t be freed</p>
<p>Dented, twisted keys, there&rsquo;s no way, even if you wanted to.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Decomposed skeleton, piled up,</p>
<p>Little blood spilled, lumps of chewed-up flesh, a heart, splinters.</p>
<p>There is no abandonment, forgetfulness, it happens.</p>
