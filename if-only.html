<h1>If only</h1>
<br>
<p>If your body is covered with roads, I want to walk them all.</p>
<br>
<p>If only there was, within the variety of vocabulary, also a word for you, a word for your language, for your notes, for your frequencies, for your melancholy. If only there were, with the complexity of tradition, a way to describe you, a word to meet you, a word to feel your skin on mine. If there actually was it, I&rsquo;d find it without letting it go, and if there was it, I&rsquo;d fill it with kisses, like I would with you. If only there was it, I wouldn&rsquo;t be looking for it. We need balance, but I forget about that, I stagger to the last emotion I can kidnap, and I rip it to shreds. It is not my usual to pretend to be shy. Alcohol makes me even closer, with my eyes even more open and fixed on you, that are as clear as the moon. Think and smile, think and weep and smile.</p>
