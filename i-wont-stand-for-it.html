<h1>I won't stand for it</h1>
<br>
<p>The only heart I have is on the floor.<br>I don&rsquo;t keep my head on my shoulders, nor my feet on the ground. There&rsquo;s no time for that. If I had a heart, I would gladly waste it on you; I would forget your name, turning it into a breeze and butterflies, carrying it hand in hand without looking at each other, our noses to the sky or to the ground, shy noses. I would forget your face to find it again in the vein beneath your lashes, in your subtle grin. I would forget your color so I could ask you about it again and again. I would forget your skin so I could touch it for the first time. There are things that never come back; purity comes from deeper than the soul, it was born from that light behind the eyes, from their impulses, their inevitable, silent conversations. And in your eyes, I see a universe different from mine that completes it, different from anything I could have imagined; I can&rsquo;t believe you can&rsquo;t see it. I know you perceive and feel me. I would forget your lips so I could sleep on them again, softly. But I would never forget you; I would never forget what you showed me with the simplicity of a tight embrace, the lightheartedness of an embarrassed yet confident, searching gaze. Your innocence kills me; it sacrifices me.<br><br></p>
