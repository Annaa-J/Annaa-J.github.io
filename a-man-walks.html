<h1>A man walks</h1>
<br>
<p>A man sinks. He sinks into the darkness, into nothingness, forgotten. You don&rsquo;t see him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a man walking, mom!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But you don&rsquo;t see him; the man walks, you don&rsquo;t see his feet, you don&rsquo;t see his arched back covered by the coat, you don&rsquo;t see his crooked cane, he walks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mom, where is he going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even pointing wouldn&rsquo;t help because you simply can&rsquo;t see him, it&rsquo;s not to blame on your dimmed eyes or the sticky fog weighing on our bones, you just couldn&rsquo;t see him anyway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No mom, it&rsquo;s not a game. He&rsquo;s walking, look!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And you don&rsquo;t see his slow and steady steps, you don&rsquo;t see his heavy, stiff shoes, irritating on the ankles from wear, his elegant hat crushed by time, his dark, worn-out trousers, you don&rsquo;t see his tired hands, the exposed nape, the rough, dry, tough skin. You can&rsquo;t see him because he is halfway sunk and isn&rsquo;t going anywhere. He stumbles and sinks his soles into the mire, relentlessly continuing his immobile, unsteady yet perpetual walk. As he approaches, more details of his motionless stride become noticeable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why isn&rsquo;t he moving, mom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>You say nothing, you don&rsquo;t see, and what you say is just air to my ears, you don&rsquo;t see that man. You don&rsquo;t see the coarse mustache still carrying the scent of pipe and gin, the gray and white hairs in his nose; you don&rsquo;t see the tears he never had the courage to cry, you don&rsquo;t see the bitter fatigue, blind to his limit that keeps him tethered to an empty destiny.</p>
<p>You see my fear, pure, my terrified eyes, my now-lost eyes, a swollen tear on the verge of the abyss falls alone, you see my pierced soul. You worry, sowing useless panic; you try to save me, but you don&rsquo;t try to understand.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t see. Frustration. Anguish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mom, why? Why does he keep walking if he doesn&rsquo;t move?&rdquo;</p>
<p>You go mad, you despair, a scene that drags on for long, but I don&rsquo;t hear your screams, your crying, your desperate caresses. I see but don&rsquo;t hear, you hear but don&rsquo;t see.</p>
<p>The man runs, he flees, while remaining in his swamp.</p>
<p>I see him, or rather, I cannot help but see him: every time I avert my gaze, I find him right there waiting for me, in front of me, right in front of my nose, as if he were a puppet whose strings are fixed to the tips of my fingers, beyond a milky and insistent stage of fog. I wish to reach him. I start running, I don&rsquo;t hear your desperate cries, I don&rsquo;t feel your nails tearing at my clothes in vain trying to stop me, and I don&rsquo;t hear your prayers, your pleas. You&rsquo;ve scratched my arms and back, you can&rsquo;t hold me back, and all I have left of you is a tug. I run to the man, but he is unreachable, and I run forever sinking into his emptiness.</p>
<p></p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t see me anymore. The fog. The escape. And you wouldn&rsquo;t see me anyway.</p>
