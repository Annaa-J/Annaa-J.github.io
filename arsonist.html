<h1>Arsonist</h1>
<br>
<p>You cry with no grimace, no expression, only impassive tears that roar like streams of bones and laughter. You lay on my tongue, on my ajar, relaxed, lifeless lips and you ignite them. You ride the current like a snake and bite my life where I am most sensitive, there is no restraint in your assault. You devour my eyes with your flames as I weep oil and I lose consciousness by acquiring yours. Flowers fly like colors of the wind but my weight does not allow me to do the same, there is no escape and I stay in a prison of you who melt me and make me something else.</p>
