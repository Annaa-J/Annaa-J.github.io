<h1>Mimetic variability</h1>
<br>
<p>I had a dream and I realized that reality does not exist, that life is an illusion. Experience is individual, intimate, it belongs to each; something objective does not exist in us, and neither something shareable, but only forms of free association that we can communicate through words, acts, smells and colours. Transmission of impulses, of dynamic ideas, in eternal movement, in eternal mutation that manifest themselves in tidal waves of thought within people and populations. I wonder what it is that keeps us connected, what makes us able to experience, are we on drugs?</p>
<p>Every substance is probably a drug for modifying our organism, so partly yes. Sleep is generated by hormones and regulated by circadian cycles that work by themselves most of the time, so, once again, partly yes, I think existence is like drugs. We experience a succession of pain and relief that we cannot order and that changes our perception and our critical spirit. But what happens in the end? When I&rsquo;m dead you&rsquo;ll all be dead too, for me, for my mind, for my existence. I think that for those who created us there is no concept of beginning and end, only the one of becoming and transformation, and that the whole universe has a breath, from the big bang to the big rip, that&rsquo;s why we cannot accept the concept of infinity, we are so low, but we impose ourselves beginning and end, as if we were long-lived. I forded a river that flowed and roared over a bridge, leading straight from one side to the other of an additional river, under the same bridge. There is feeling in us, and this makes us slaves in distinguishing pragmatism from natural becoming without purpose.</p>
<p>Damn fools we are, who still measure time, real fools, that we measure space, fools, to always measure everything, while everything changes, while we are inaccurate, and we cannot be otherwise. It is convenient for us for our stupid means, but to understand, to understand life, this is useless.</p>
<p>We are too small to think about space as an elastic membrane and universe, too short to conceive of time as unstable and to perceive and discover its limitation in infinity, the infinitesimal in the finite. We are too malleable and sensitive (not in terms of sensory impulses due to stimuli), to compare life with death. Everything is linked to a personal inner flight, to a river flowing on a bridge that's over a river, to solidarity, to emotion, instant, to inspiration. What is born when the universe is born? And what does it come from? Why? When will it die? Why? These are human questions, which we try to answer, but aware that most of our prediction will be incomplete, and that we will totally divert whole concepts, like that of a life, which we cannot deal with in our own terms, with our own conjectures.</p>
<p>Nature does not resemble us, or rather, no longer. She knows herself and does not need to wonder, she spontaneously changes and evolves with criterion. We get lost, we sink into our minds as if it were reliable and logical, what happened?</p>
<p>Now I have to get dressed and go to college, who knows if I&rsquo;ll learn something new.</p>
<p>Maybe we will find the way to know what life is one day, what activates us at birth and turns us off at death, what makes us present and conscious. Maybe one day we&rsquo;ll take it for granted as we take for granted the fall of an apple from a tree on the ground.</p>
