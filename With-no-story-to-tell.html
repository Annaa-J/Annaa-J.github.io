<h1>With no story to tell</h1>
<br>
<p>There is no life, no breath deeper than yours. We will not know how to save. I stopped, my hands paralyzed and my eyes fixed on a plasterboad wall disguised as marble, not letting me out; I am in a blue tunnel of inertia where my strength means nothing against the magnitude of disappointment and regret. I only have frustration cutting the ligaments of my ankles. I try to get up but it&apos;s impossible; I am another person, I must start over from scratch. I have entered someone else&apos;s body; it&rsquo;s not me. I feel elsewhere, not present; I&rsquo;m in a place I don&rsquo;t know, surrounded by people I&apos;ve never seen, pretending to remember about them. I am nothing; if I had a name yesterday, today I have lost it&mdash;it&rsquo;s just a number and inscription that means nothing, an accessory, I don&rsquo;t remember it. Today, I don&rsquo;t remember my name because the one they give me is not mine, and I cannot find the real one. I cannot be this character, and I feel another person inside me. I just want to regain control of myself. Changes cannot destroy so much; I won&rsquo;t accept it. It&rsquo;s a joke or a game, an exchange; someone took my life, and I want my joy back, my imagination. It was stolen, and now I find myself in a stupid, incapable, senseless, insensitive soul. I am afraid, I tremble; there is no more pure emotion, only resentment, escape, I am running. I am running away from myself, and this is the biggest mistake I&rsquo;ve ever made. I promised I wouldn&rsquo;t lie to myself; I swore I&rsquo;d be honest, and you made me lie, you made me a slave, you changed me. I won&rsquo;t accept it. You turned me into a sterile, aseptic person, empty of life and with no real smile, with no story to tell. With no story to tell. With no story to tell. With no story to tell. With no story to tell. As if I had nothing to tell, as if I didn&rsquo;t have a river of tears to recount, as if I didn&rsquo;t have a tidal wave of lava ready to sweep the world, as if I couldn&rsquo;t tell it, as if I weren&rsquo;t capable. I reflected, I dug, I scraped and risked, I scratched with my nails at the bottom of the cell that was dug around me because it was possible to get out on the other side of the world with force, while I did not have the ability to climb. I took the longest and hardest road, faced myself, gathered all the strength I didn&rsquo;t have, funneled it and crushed it to make it into something, a crumb. And I dug, I dug, mother, I swear I dug deeply through every surface, every rock, and through the sand. I dug through lava and magma, burned my body that couldn&rsquo;t survive, and used another one, recovered it from nowhere, pulled it out of darkness; indeed, it&rsquo;s now defective and doesn&rsquo;t have much to say. I must force it, as I had to push it with nonexistent energy to cross the earth&rsquo;s core, hard as a thousand diamonds, and force it to endure the heat, the scratches, the blows. It lost its nails while digging; fingers wore away, then hands; calluses formed everywhere, even on the tongue from how hard it bit down&mdash;not a hint of pain could show; it had to bear every struggle, every wound. It took me beyond the center of the earth, mother, it made it, and it was happy; it saw a goal in motion. I wondered if I could write something more specific, more personal, intimate, and private. I wondered how to reach a heart and couldn&rsquo;t keep it alive; I let it wither, not through my fault or oversight. I let it hurt me and strike me and strike me and push me and push me away and strike me. I had to do it alone, mother; the chaos I created was unavoidable. I tried everything, gave my all, every ounce of strength I didn&rsquo;t have I gave to you to carry me away, out of the tunnel I dug into the ground that keeps me captive. You led me along the longest path; the short one was impracticable, and you brought me to a point where I would have to rise again, to the center, to the heart, beneath the heavy shell of the earth. Mother, I had to go down to the origins, to the core of every origin. I descended into the underworld where everything began, a cataclysm. I felt how hard rock can be and how hot the world can be; I experienced the pain of solitude in struggle, sweating every drop of water in my body.<br><br></p>
<p>I claim not to have used my body for all this; I do not claim this virtue. I never had that strength; it was never mine. I stole it, or you gave it to me, with this new body that cries without being seen, that bites its tongue to shreds but doesn&rsquo;t open its mouth. This dead body that is stronger than I am and takes me to the starting points. From the center, it leaves to me the hardest part: once you descend, you must climb back up, and I climbed. I sank my maimed arms into molten metal and scraped off the ceiling above my head to pass through, climbing and pushing my feet against the walls. I couldn&rsquo;t let go, not even for a moment, or I would fall back to the bottom, to the center, to the starting point. I did this alone, mother; I did what I couldn&rsquo;t even imagine doing. I surpassed everything; I shattered every slab of rock and concrete and every mass of metal. I swam upward through the lava and finally broke through the earth with my head. I looked up, and there was the sky; I looked up, and you were there, still. You brought me back to you, bringing me back to life, even though you&rsquo;re gone. You made sure to see me again by giving me what you don&rsquo;t have, what was taken from you by those who write the world&rsquo;s history but couldn&rsquo;t do the same to me because you deceived them, and before you left, you gave me everything.<br>I won&rsquo;t lose again, I promise, and I won&rsquo;t be as weak as I was before. I will have the courage of a tiger defending her cubs, and I will take what I touch and turn it into wonder, turn it into love. I will take death and turn it into vindication; I will have life and be pure and graceful in my smile, disordered and chaotic on the journey. There is no need to always have a path; sometimes, I can follow my instincts and let words guide me as if they were sap flowing through the veins of a tree. I would like a gigantic, colossal tree that can bear the weight of my heart when it is broken into pieces and that can heal and reassemble its beats. And I would like it to bear the weight when it has so much joy it could burst. I would like...<br><br></p>
