<h1>Drop</h1>
<br>
<p>It happens that a drop does not find a place to land,</p>
<p>as if it was nice knowing that you&rsquo;re falling, as if it was right and normal.</p>
<p>It happens that a drop does not end up in the sea, does not lay on a flower and does not take a color.</p>
<p>The others are watching, crossed by the rays of the powerful sun,</p>
<p>sparkling with light and oscillating color, sitting at the end on a striped face,</p>
<p>They lie for a long time on a musky bed, wobbly sliding on a burning fireplace.</p>
<p>But she doesn't stop falling, what a shame, she doesn't want to land, she just can't accept it.</p>
<p>It happens that a drop does not find her place, she was maybe too light to get her feet on the ground.</p>
