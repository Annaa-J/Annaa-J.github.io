<h1>An extinct painter</h1>
<br>
<p>"Where your sea begins, mine dies."</p>
<p>From the large, gaping windows, whose blue skeletons lost several flakes of paint, the curtains floated in the room creating soft, candid figures swollen like freshwater nymphs.</p>
<p>"What does this mean, Stella?"</p>
<p>Stella looked down on the peeling jambs and lost herself in staring at the branch of crooked narrow streets sunken between the islets of plaster, thinking it over, before answering him.</p>
<p>"Look at the sea and it will be clear to you."</p>
<p>There was no sea to contemplate, nor was it nearby, so Diego drew a thick and rigid sheet of paper from the drawer and picked up a soft graphite pencil from the wooden table.</p>
<p>"This is where they blend." Indicating with the sharp and irregular mine the center of the sheet, Diego dragged the attention to a more wrinkled and wavy area; the zone was presented as a few, small lumps of hills and valleys of paper distributed in clusters in the middle of the smooth surface. He summarily traced with the tip the outline of some of them, the shapes arose abstract and shaky, reminiscent of the rain.</p>
<p>"I cried last night, I couldn&rsquo;t find an inspiration to paint, so I gave up." He reopened the drawer under the table, retrieving a pack of other drawing sheets, all in the same condition, and repeated the drawing on the paper wet and dried by tears; he stopped at the fourth sheet, placed them on the table one adjacent to the other, two at the top and two at the bottom, then turned them one by one, reading the dates written quickly in a corner on the back.</p>
<p>"Every evening, sitting in that wicker chair, I set out to create a work that represents what I feel for you through graphite and watercolour, most of the time, however, I find myself observing for hours this white background that, if it were not the edges to delimit it, it would eat the room in a bite with the voracity of a beggar. I think of how beautiful you would be painted as a tiny and delicate fairy swirling among the flowers, but my hand does not want to draw lines and I remain inert until the darkness forces me to light some candles; this passage breaks my involuntary meditation and for a moment I rise from alienation. Hours later even the stars scratch my pride shining impassive facing my failure; helpless I watch my creativity dissolve as the dismayed children lose their balloons in the sky. The wicks burn to allow me to see and the wax melts to recompose in lumpy and dancing shapes on silver saucers, while I remain unusable, like a broken or incomplete machine. I can&rsquo;t expect to function without someone fixing me. That's how I realize I have rivers of tears that run docile on my cheekbones and down to the chin from which they take free flight towards the centre of the sheet, soaking it. I don&rsquo;t even dry my eyes, I wait for them to dry out by themselves, after that I put the result of my work in this drawer and I get myself to sleep."</p>
<p>Only the sound of the wind through the trees answered him, with no change in intensity, as if to mock him with disinterest.</p>
<p>"Here, within the outlines I have defined, our seas mingle, but, for the rest of the canvas, we are but strangers and our lives diverge like twigs born in opposite directions."</p>
<p>After a few seconds Stella finally loosened her lips, no emotion showed from her face, and neither from her spirit.</p>
<p>"Do you mean that your tears are your attempt to be my husband not only on paper?"</p>
<p>"I mean so."</p>
